## Other information

This app supports two functionalities.
1. First, it is used as record keeper app for general public who may not or may have contracted, suspected, infected or recovered ISIR model) from Covid or any harmful virus disease.

2. Second part of this app is related to one Artificial Intelligence algorithm I am working on for research purpose. 

Data panel, is strictly used in research purpose program (strictly prohibiting any personal data use). 
Users described in Section-1 will have an option to decline participation, so that their data must not be used for any research or any other purpose.

This section of app, use participant data for an Artificial Intelligence research program, which may provide useful predictive analytics, insight to vaccine distribution strategy to local government healthcare workers to strategize vaccine distribution strategy, like, where when and who should get vaccines.

Further, this AI research uses public data features like Gender, age, location, travel, past medical history and SIR (suspected, infected, recovered) information. This AI strictly does not use any personal information like name, phone number, email or interest for any research or commercial purpose.

Like my all other community project, This app is MIT style license, that means, itâ€™s completely free of any charge and you can also change it as per your business requirements, however I will not be liable for what you do with this.

I hope community find this app useful.
In case of any issues, please do not contact me via email and open a new GitHub issue instead.

### bugs
